## Description 📝
This project was made solely with html and css. My idea was re-creating a windows experience. Because windows often has many errors i decided it would be funny to to recreate it. I did that with first starting on a windows 10 screen, and the going back in time to a windows XP desktop. 


## My assignment

- (x) Custom

I decided to make my own HTML for this project.

## My contexts

You have to add one extra contexts to your site

- [x] Custom

## Two restrictions I picked
You have to work with _at least_ two of these restrictions.

- [x] When SVG meets CSS: Shapes / Masks / SVG
- [x] Recreate a great experience with only pop-ups

My 'great' experience is working with windows, it can be quite fun but also sometimes not so great. 

## The *Selector First* CSS Methodology
I have to work with the so called *Selector First* CSS Methodology. This means that I have to use a wide variety of CSS selectors. ID’s are only allowed to trigger the `:target` selector. If I really need them, I am allowed to use a few classes. In order to differentiate between. I'm also allowed to use ID's to make target selectors

## My findings
This is a list of things i tried that worked, or did not work but did try.

* SVG animation
* :root
* All the selectors (+ ~ > etc.)
* :last-of-type
* :first-of-type
* :nth-of-type(4n-7)
* Checkbox hack
* ::after
* ::before
* :target
* huerotate()
* :grid-template-areas
* @keyframes
* @keyframes d:path()
* Different notations of CSS
* Inheritance

## What did not work (or make it to the end product)
This list contains most of the stuff that didn't work or i just didn't put in the end product.

* The whole docs/old folder
* 3d effect on a wall with text moving in
* Multiple checkbox linking
* Svg to svg animation on hover
* 

## Sources 📚
Sources i used throughout the project.

  * None
